How to compile and run from command line ?

If you have Qt SDK properly installed, the you can just do
qmake; make -j5;

because paths to assets and images are taken relative to this directory.
So you can do:

cd bin
./pexeso


How to compile and run from Qt Creator ?

To compile and run from Qt Creator just double click the pexeso.pro file.
